# go-web-server-tips

This project demonstrates some code practices I use when writing web servers in Go.

## Practices
- [x] Use clean architecture
    - Good code organization/folder structure
    - Decouple dependencies

- [x] Extend HTTP handler
    - Handle errors in one location

- [x] Standardized response format

- [x] Create custom errors for client errors
    - Clean error handling

- [ ] ozzo-validator with custom validator?
    - Struct validation outside controller

- [ ] Integration testing with testify?
